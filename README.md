# Audur

## Disclaimer
The true potential of Audur can be unlocked only when it is hosted on a cloud service/virtual machine.
Locally, the features would still work, but they might not make much sense to the layman.

## Purpose
This is an audio equivalent of Imgur - a service where images can be shareed anonymously. 
Here, users can share audio files anonymously. 
I am currenly working on a feature to screen out audio files for potential offensive/hateful content - to ensure the application is not used for malice.
Initially a Flask application, it is now working with Spring Boot.
